We welcome you and thank you for investing your talents and time in building bots using Microsoft’s Bot Framework.

Microsoft will review your bot submission to make sure it meets certain minimum requirements before it is publicly available on the Bot Directory. Following are some criteria we use to evaluate your bot before publication to the Bot Directory:

<section>
    <ol class="list-counter">
<li>Your bot must do something meaningful that adds value to the user (e.g., respond to basic commands, have at least some level of communication etc.)</li>

<li>The bot profile image, name, keywords and description must NOT:</li>
<ol>
<li>Be offensive or explicit;</li>
<li>Include third party trademarks, service marks or logos;</li>
<li>impersonate or imply endorsement by a third party;</li>
<li>use names unrelated to the bot;</li>
<li>use Microsoft logos, trademarks or service marks unless you have permission from Microsoft;</li>
<li>be too long or verbose. The description should be 8-10 words.</li>
</ol>
<li>Microsoft Bot Framework does not currently support payments within bots.  Your bot may not transmit financial instrument details through the user to bot interface. However, your bot may transmit links to secure payment services to users but you must disclose this in your bot’s terms of use and privacy policy (and any profile page or website for the bot) before a user agrees to use your bot. </li>
<li>Your Terms of Service link is required for submission and publication to the Bot Directory. If your bot handles users’ personal data and in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and policy requirements, you must also provide a link to an applicable privacy policy for submission and publication to the Bot Directory. In addition, you will need to ensure that you follow the privacy notice requirements as communicated in the Developer Code of Conduct for the Microsoft Bot Framework referenced here: <a href="https://aka.ms/bf-conduct" class="uri">https://aka.ms/bf-conduct</a></li>
<li>The bot must operate as described in its bot description, profile, terms of use and privacy policy. You must notify Microsoft in advance if you make any material changes to your bot. Microsoft has the right, in its sole discretion, to intermittently review bots on the Bot Directory and remove bots from the Bot Directory without notice.</li>
<li>Your bot must operate in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Microsoft Bot Framework <a href="https://www.botframework.com/Content/Microsoft-Bot-Framework-Preview-Online-Services-Agreement.htm">Online Services Agreement</a> and Developer Code of Conduct for the Microsoft Bot Framework.</li>
<li>Changes made to your bot’s registration may require your bot to be re-reviewed to ensure that it continues to meet the requirements stated here.</p>
<p>Although Microsoft will review your bot to confirm it meets certain minimum requirements prior to publication on the Bot Directory, you are solely responsible for: (1) your bot; (2) its content and actions; (3) compliance with all applicable laws; (4) compliance with any third party terms and conditions; and (5) compliance with the Microsoft Bot Framework Online Services Agreement, Privacy Statement and Developer Code of Conduct for the Microsoft Bot Framework. Microsoft’s review and publication of your bot to the Bot Directory is not an endorsement of your bot.</li>
<li>Keep your Microsoft Account email active as we will use that for all bot-related communication with you.</li>
    </ol>
